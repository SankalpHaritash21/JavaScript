/*for (..in) loop: The JavaScript for (..in) statement loops through the enumerable properties of an object. The loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of the object itself and those the object inherits from its constructorâ€™s prototype.

Syntax
for (variable in object)
  statement
Example
*/

for (..of) loop: This for (..of) statement lets you loop over the data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, Node Lists, and more. It calls a custom iteration hook with instructions to execute on the value of each property of the object.

Syntax
for (variable of iterable) {
  statement
}
Example:
*/

let text = ["Sankalp", " Haritash ", "43"];
let userId1 = "";
let j;
for (j of text) {
  userId1 += j;
}
console.log(userId1);
/*
Output: As you can see the for (..of) loop iterate over only the content of the Array object.
